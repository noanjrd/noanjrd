> I’m a student who builds with curiosity, experiments with passion, and hopes my work might help someone, somewhere, someday. I build because turning ideas into reality never gets old.

## What I'm Doing

- **Learning by building** - diving deep into every 42 project to master new concepts and strengthen problem-solving skills  
- **Going from C to the web** - exploring the contrast between low-level systems programming and modern full-stack development  
- **Experimenting and iterating** - building side projects to apply what I learn, explore new ideas, and continuously improve my skills  
- **Collaborating and sharing** - learning from peers, contributing to projects, and connecting with the developer community
